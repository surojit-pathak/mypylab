Jack and Daniel are friends. 
They want to encrypt their conversation so that they can save themselves from interception by a detective agency. So they invent a new cipher. 
Every message is encoded to its binary representation BB of length NN. 
Then it is written down KK times, shifted by 0,1,⋯,K−10,1,⋯,K−1 bits. 
If B=1001010B=1001010 and K=4K=4 it looks so:

1001010   
 1001010  
  1001010 
   1001010
Then calculate XOR in every column and write it down. This number is called SS. For example, XOR-ing the numbers in the above example results in

1110100110
Then the encoded message SS and KK are sent to Daniel.

Jack is using this encoding algorithm and asks Daniel to implement a decoding algorithm. 
Can you help Daniel implement this?

Input Format 
The first line contains two integers NN and KK. 
The second line contains string SS of length N+K−1N+K−1 consisting of ones and zeros.

Output Format 
Decoded message of length NN, consisting of ones and zeros.

Constraints 
1≤N≤1061≤N≤106 
1≤K≤1061≤K≤106 
|S|=N+K−1|S|=N+K−1 
It is guaranteed that SS is correct.
