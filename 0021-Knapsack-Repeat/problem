Given a list of n integers, A={a1,a2,…,an}, and another integer, k representing the expected sum. Select zero or more numbers from A such that the sum of these numbers is as near as possible, but not exceeding, to the expected sum (k).

Note

Each element of A can be selected multiple times.
If no element is selected then the sum is 0.

Input Format

The first line contains T the number of test cases. 
Each test case comprises of two lines. First line contains two integers, n k, representing the length of list AA and expected sum, respectively. Second line consists of nn space separated integers, a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an, representing the elements of list AA.
