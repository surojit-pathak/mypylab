Get the decimal value for a given integer in roman representation.


Notes:
- only I and X are used as prefix for subtraction
- keeping a counter of max and running total does the job, if we adding going high from max and subtract otherwise, on the reverse string
  - but can not assert the sanity of the roman string
  - xiiiv => 13
